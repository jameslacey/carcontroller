You can view detailed information about the remote control car at http://jamesl.tk/gallery.html
I can be reached as jamesl on IRC (Freenode and Foonetic) if you would like more information.

The remote control car is controlled by two scripts, carcontroller.sh is on a raspberry pi zero in the controller, it runs as 
init, so is executed shortly after the kernel boots. It receives inputs from GPIO pins and transmits them through a Slice of Radio. 

Another script runs on a XinoRF (Arduino UNO compatible with a radio module preinstalled) on the car itself and controls the motors and lights using a motor shield. A Raspberry Pi running wifibroadcast also transmits video from the onboard camera over wifi, to be received using a wifi dongle and a laptop. This is useful for controlling it remotely.

I have made these publicly accessible so that others can design remote control projects using these files, adapting them for their needs.
